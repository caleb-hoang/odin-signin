# odin-signin

A mock webpage simulating a sign-in page for an imaginary service, made as a project for the "Odin Project: Intermediate HTML" course. Features form validation, custom form stylization.

This webpage is PARTIALLY responsive - the logo on the left side will dynamically change size to fit the screen, but the webpage is currently unfit for mobile devices.

To run locally: Open index.html in your browser of choice.
