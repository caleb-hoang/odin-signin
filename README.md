# odin-signin


## Overview
A mock webpage simulating a sign-in page for an imaginary service, made as a project for the "Odin Project: Intermediate HTML" course. Features form validation, custom form stylization.

This webpage is PARTIALLY responsive - the logo on the left side will dynamically change size to fit the screen, but the webpage is currently unfit for mobile devices. My main goal when completing this project was making as MUCH of the webpage responsive to viewport size as possible - very few values, if any, (font size, width, height, etc.) are hard-coded in. Reacts somewhat unpredictably to different zoom levels.

## Things I did beyond the project guidelines:
- Changed the color scheme to a dark/neon aesthetic.
- Added animated transitions to input box borders.
- Removed "focus ring" on text boxes
